InMoose offers a Python port of the well-known R Bioconductor packages:

- `DESeq2 package <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html>`_ [Love2014]_ in module :doc:`deseq`.
- `edgeR package <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html>`_ [Chen2016]_ in module :doc:`edgepy`.
- `limma package <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html>`_ [Ritchie2015]_. in module :doc:`limma`.

Note that not all features of the R packages are necessarily ported. Extending
the functionality of these modules will be based on user requests, so do not
hesitate to open an issue if your favorite feature is missing.
